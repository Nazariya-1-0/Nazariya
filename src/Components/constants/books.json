                "The poor and middle-class work for money. The rich have money work for them.",
                "Growing up, Robert Kiyosaki was intrigued by the question of how to make money, especially since he attended a school filled with affluent students while being poor himself. He teamed up with his friend Mike and attempted various money-making ventures, including an unsuccessful and illegal attempt at casting fake nickels. They sought guidance from Mike's father, who happened to be Robert's rich dad. Instead of teaching them in a traditional classroom setting, the rich dad offered them a deal to work for him and learn through practical experience.",
                "Initially, the boys performed monotonous tasks for a minimal wage. However, Robert grew frustrated and wanted to quit. When he confronted his rich dad about this, he learned an important lesson about seizing opportunities and choosing one's mindset. The rich dad emphasized that the wealthy have money work for them, while the poor and middle-class work for money. He also highlighted the role of fear in keeping people trapped in the cycle of working for money.",
                "Following this lesson, the rich dad renegotiated their arrangement, asking Robert and Mike to work for free. Eventually, he introduced them to the concept of the rat race and attempted to entice them with increasing hourly pay rates, which they refused. They understood that becoming wealthy required a different approach.",
                "Inspired by their rich dad's teachings, the boys started a successful venture, creating a library where kids could read comic books for a fee. This experience taught them the value of making money work for them and opened their eyes to opportunities others might overlook."
